# DAL Rinne Utopia Recomp

Static recompilation of the PS3 title *Date A Live: Rinne Utopia* (BLJM61048) for
Windows, built from your own copy of the game.

This repository contains no game data. No executables, keys, or decrypted binaries are
included or accepted by version control; you supply your own `EBOOT.elf`, and all tool
output is written to ignored directories.

Current state: build scaffold, a small runtime stub, and analysis tools for the PPU
executable (ELF summary, SPU probe, disassembler, Ghidra cross-check, NID and syscall name
tables). Recompilation itself is not implemented yet.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2026 with the Windows SDK (provides the MSVC headers and libraries)
- PowerShell 7 and the `VSSetup` module (`Install-Module VSSetup -Scope CurrentUser`)
- clang and clang++ with lld (a standalone LLVM install; see `-LlvmBin` below)
- CMake 3.29 or newer
- Ninja
- Python 3.10 or newer (the analysis tools use only the standard library)
- Optional, for `ghidra-export` only: Ghidra 12.x and a JDK 21 (see below)
- Optional, for `nidgen` only: git and a sparse checkout of the RPCS3 sources (see below)

## Obtaining `EBOOT.elf`

The tools work on the decrypted PPU executable, not on `EBOOT.BIN`.

1. Dump your own disc or digital copy and install it in RPCS3.
2. In RPCS3, use Utilities > Decrypt PS3 Binaries and select the game's `EBOOT.BIN`.
3. Take the resulting `EBOOT.elf` and place it anywhere you like. The `game/` directory in
   the repository root is git-ignored and works well for this.

`*.elf`, `*.self`, `*.sprx`, `*.prx`, `*.sdat`, and `*.edat` are also git-ignored.

## Building

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/build.ps1 [-Preset debug|release] [-Clean] [-Test] [-EbootElf <path>] [-LlvmBin <dir>]
```

- `-Preset` selects the CMake preset (`debug` by default, or `release`). Build output goes
  to `build/<preset>/`.
- `-Clean` removes that preset's build directory before configuring.
- `-Test` runs CTest after the build: a runtime version check, a `musttail` support
  check, and the Python unit tests.
- `-EbootElf <path>` passes the decrypted ELF to the tests so the checks against the real
  executable run instead of being skipped.
- `-LlvmBin <dir>` puts a specific LLVM `bin` directory first on `PATH`. It defaults to the
  `DAL_LLVM_BIN` environment variable. Use it when the clang bundled with Visual Studio is
  too old or when clang is not on `PATH`.

The script enters the Visual Studio developer shell itself unless it is already running in
one, then configures, builds, and optionally tests.

Examples:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/build.ps1 -Preset debug -Clean -Test
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/build.ps1 -Preset release -Test -EbootElf game/EBOOT.elf
```

## Analysis tools

`tools/ps3tool.py` has six subcommands. Each takes the path to the decrypted ELF, except
`nidgen`, which reads an RPCS3 checkout.

```sh
python tools/ps3tool.py info   <elf> [-o OUTPUT] [--target-config FILE] [--nids FILE] [--no-verify]
python tools/ps3tool.py probe  <elf> [-o OUTPUT] [--syscalls FILE]
python tools/ps3tool.py disasm <elf> (--start ADDR (--count N | --end ADDR) | --entry [--count N] | --stats [--start ADDR --end ADDR] [--json OUT]) [--raw] [--strict]
python tools/ps3tool.py ghidra-export <elf> [--ghidra-dir DIR] [--language ID] [--cspec ID] [--project-dir DIR] [-o OUT] [--start ADDR] [--end ADDR] [--timeout SEC] [--check-only]
python tools/ps3tool.py ghidra-diff   <elf> --ghidra JSON [--start ADDR] [--end ADDR] [--strict] [-o OUT] [--top N] [--examples K]
python tools/ps3tool.py nidgen --rpcs3 DIR [--source-commit COMMIT] [--nids-out FILE] [--syscalls-out FILE]
```

- `info` checks the file against the pinned SHA-256 and writes a JSON summary (segments,
  sections, imports, exports) to `generated/analysis/eboot_info.json`. It refuses encrypted
  input. `--no-verify` skips the hash check. Each import is given a name from the FNID
  table (`--nids`, default `config/nids.json`). The summary line reports how many imports
  are named, and every import without a name is listed as `unresolved import`. If the
  default table is missing, names stay `null` and a note is printed.
- `probe` searches for embedded SPU images and SPU-related imports, counts lv2 syscall
  sites and numbers, and writes `generated/analysis/probe.json`. The syscall number is
  recovered by scanning backwards from each `sc` for the `r11` load, through conditional
  branches; sites where it cannot be determined are counted as unresolved. Numbers are
  mapped to names with the table given by `--syscalls` (default
  `config/lv2_syscalls.json`).
- `disasm` prints PPU disassembly for an address range (`--start` with `--count` or
  `--end`) or from the entry function (`--entry`). `--raw` disables simplified mnemonics.
  `--strict` prints words whose reserved bits are set as `.long` instead of decoding them.
  `--stats` decodes every word of the executable segments (or of `[--start, --end)`) and
  reports the number of decoded and unknown words, the most common mnemonics and unknown
  opcode patterns, and a strict section: how many words still decode under reserved-bit
  checking and which mnemonics are rejected most often. `--json OUT` also writes the
  statistics as JSON.
- `ghidra-export` and `ghidra-diff` cross-check the decoder against Ghidra; see below.
- `nidgen` builds the name tables from RPCS3 sources; see below.

Run `python tools/ps3tool.py <command> --help` for the full option list.

### Ghidra cross-check

`ghidra-export` runs Ghidra headless on the ELF and writes a JSON file with the function
list and a per-word listing of the code range. `ghidra-diff` then compares that listing
with this repository's PPU decoder word by word. This is a validation aid for the decoder;
nothing else depends on it.

Requirements: Ghidra 12.x and a JDK 21 (the JDK that Ghidra 12 itself requires). Point the
tool at the Ghidra install directory with the `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or
`--ghidra-dir DIR`. The export scripts are Java `GhidraScript`s in `tools/ghidra/`, so no
Python environment for Ghidra is needed.

```sh
python tools/ps3tool.py ghidra-export <elf>
python tools/ps3tool.py ghidra-diff   <elf> --ghidra generated/ghidra/eboot_ghidra.json
python tools/ps3tool.py ghidra-diff   <elf> --ghidra generated/ghidra/eboot_ghidra.json --strict
```

- `ghidra-export` imports the ELF with language `PowerPC:BE:64:A2ALT-32addr` (override with
  `--language` and `--cspec`), runs auto-analysis, and exports the range given by
  `--start`/`--end` (default: the largest executable section). Analysis of the real
  executable takes under a minute and is cut off after `--timeout` seconds (default 3600).
  The tool then checks that Ghidra decodes a few probe instructions (including AltiVec
  ones) as expected, so a wrong language setting is reported. `--check-only` skips Ghidra
  and only validates and language-checks an existing export.
- Output goes under `generated/ghidra/`: the export JSON (`eboot_ghidra.json`), the Ghidra
  project (`project/`) and the Ghidra logs (`logs/`). All of it is git-ignored.
- `ghidra-diff` classifies every word of the range into one category and prints the
  counts. The report is written to `generated/analysis/ghidra_diff.json` (`-o` to change
  it), with the most frequent mismatching pairs and a few examples for each.

  | Category | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `match` | Ghidra treats the word as code and both decoders agree |
  | `known_difference` | Both decode it, but the mnemonic pair is a recorded, explained difference |
  | `ghidra_code_we_unknown` | Ghidra treats the word as code and this decoder does not know it |
  | `mnemonic_mismatch` | Both decode it and the mnemonics differ |
  | `operand_mismatch` | Both decode it with the same mnemonic and the operands differ |
  | `we_code_ghidra_noncode` | Ghidra treats the word as data or undefined, this decoder decodes it |
  | `both_noncode_unknown` | Ghidra treats the word as data or undefined and this decoder does not know it |

  `ghidra_code_we_unknown`, `mnemonic_mismatch` and `operand_mismatch` are the categories
  that point at decoder bugs. The last two are only recorded.
- `--strict` makes `ghidra-diff` decode with reserved-bit checking, as `disasm --strict`
  does. Words that have reserved bits set then count as unknown to this decoder, so the
  category counts change accordingly.

## NID and syscall name tables

Imports are identified by FNID and lv2 syscalls by number. `nidgen` extracts both name
tables from the RPCS3 sources, which are not included in this repository. The generated
tables are committed:

- `config/nids.json`: module name, then FNID, to function name.
- `config/lv2_syscalls.json`: syscall number to name.

Each file records the RPCS3 repository URL and the commit it was generated from, so the
names can be traced to a specific revision. Regenerate them when the RPCS3 sources change:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3.git <rpcs3-dir>
git -C <rpcs3-dir> sparse-checkout set rpcs3/Emu/Cell
python tools/ps3tool.py nidgen --rpcs3 <rpcs3-dir>
```

`--rpcs3` is the checkout root. The commit is read from the checkout's `.git` directory
(`--source-commit` overrides it). `--nids-out` and `--syscalls-out` select other output
paths, for example to compare a regenerated table with the committed one before replacing
it. `nidgen` only reads text files in the checkout and never executes anything from it. It
prints macro counts and any constructs it could not handle, and exits with a non-zero
status if the syscall table disagrees with its own comments.

## Tests

Python unit tests use synthetic ELF files built in memory. Tests that need the real
executable are skipped unless `DAL_EBOOT_ELF` points at it. The Ghidra comparison tests
additionally need `DAL_GHIDRA_JSON`, the path of an export written by `ghidra-export`, and
are skipped without it. The tests never run Ghidra themselves.

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -t tools -v
DAL_EBOOT_ELF=game/EBOOT.elf python -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -t tools -v
DAL_EBOOT_ELF=game/EBOOT.elf DAL_GHIDRA_JSON=generated/ghidra/eboot_ghidra.json python -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -t tools -v
```

## Target pin

`config/target.json` records the title ID and the size and SHA-256 of both the encrypted
`EBOOT.bin` and the decrypted `EBOOT.elf` that the tools were written against. It never
contains paths. `ps3tool.py info` compares the input with the `eboot_elf` entry so analysis
results are only trusted for the expected build.
